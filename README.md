# AI Job Risk Prediction

This project predicts whether a given job role is at **Low**, **Moderate**, or **High** risk of automation using machine learning.  
It is my first ML project as a fresher to showcase my skills in data preprocessing, model building, and deployment preparation.



##  Features
- Takes job-related numerical features as input.
- Uses a trained **Random Forest Classifier**.
- Outputs a **Risk Level**: `Low`, `Moderate`, or `High`.
- Demonstrates **data preprocessing, scaling, and encoding**.

  # Results
Accuracy: ~99% after SMOTE balancing.

Classification Report:

High: 100% Precision

Low: 99% Precision

Moderate: 100% Precision
